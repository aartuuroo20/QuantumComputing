# QuantumComputing

In this repository I attach all my projects and works done with quantum computing during my stay in the HPC & Quantum department of Eviden Iberia.

The repository consists of the following elements:
-Algorithms: In this folder you can find those algorithms developed on quantum computing such as Grover's algorithm.
-Classical Cryptography: Different types of classical encryption algorithms for further research and possible application in quantum.
-Data encoding: Types of classical data encoding in quantum for further use in e.g. machine learning.
-Scripts: Python scripts for later use in data extraction from excel and csv.
-Plugins: Implementation of different plugins of the Eviden myQLM open source framework.
-Simple gates: Implementation of quantum gates using myQLM.
